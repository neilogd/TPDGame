----------

* Bases can be upgraded, need to fix it.
* Potatoes should do more, i.e. tap them during attack phase and they drop like a mine.
* Structures turn sideways in water (just weigh them down with a point under them)
* Indication of level the structures are at.
* Indication of upgrade cost of structures.
* Screenshake seems to affect the phyiscs (i.e. makes structures turn upside down...)
* Seems possible to keep on going forever.
